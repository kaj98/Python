# Python 101 (+ examples provided)
```
Description:
This project is a collection of Python programming exercises focused on fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
The exercises range from string manipulations and control flow to mathematical calculations and data structure operations.
Each exercise includes comprehensive solutions with well-documented code and meaningful variable names to enhance clarity and understanding.

Key Features:
- Basic Data Types and Conversions: Exercises to convert between integers, floats, and strings, with examples of Python's int(), float(), and str() functions.
- String Operations: Detailed exercises on string concatenation, repetition, indexing, and slicing, demonstrating how to manipulate and extract substrings.
- Control Flow and Conditional Statements: Tasks that involve decision-making structures such as if, else, and elif to control the flow of the program based on different conditions.
- Mathematical Calculations: Solutions for area and circumference calculations, including handling negative values and performing operations with Python's math library.
- Loops and Iterations: Examples of for and while loops to perform repetitive tasks, including nested loops and use cases like pattern printing and calculations.
- Functions and Algorithms: Creation of Python functions to solve specific tasks such as finding the second highest and lowest numbers in a list, calculating BMI, and handling complex input conditions.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language for solving various tasks.
- Math Library: For mathematical calculations like finding the area of a circle or BMI.
- List and Dictionary Operations: Hands-on experience with Python's list and dictionary data structures, including element access, modification, and key-value pair manipulation.

Learning Outcomes:
- Develop a solid understanding of basic and intermediate Python programming concepts.
- Apply problem-solving techniques using loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Gain experience in writing clean, readable, and well-documented Python code.
- Explore practical examples of string manipulation, data type conversions, and algorithm design.
